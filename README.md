# stack_convert

This is the Python implementation of a utility used to take stack traces (initially generated by DTrace) and converting them into a form that can be used by [d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph).

This utility was originally implemented in Perl, and was heavily recursive, something that Python can have trouble with.

Therefore, this implementation uses techniques to turn recursive algorithms into iterative ones, to avoid that problem.
